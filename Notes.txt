Regarding the Drawing Scene:
____________________________________________________
Keep in mind that when you scale the drawing canvas unevenly, to also make sure to adjust the DrawCanvasRT size to match that ratio.
The projection size of the camera attached to the drawing canvas must also match the size of the canvas, as it's the sensor area of the pen.

Example:
In case of a scale of [0.2, 0.2, 0.4], you would have to adjust the size of DrawCanvasRT, so that the Y axis is twice as big as the X
-> Meaning that [2048, 2048] should be changed into [2048, 4096], so twice the amount of value X, as 0.4 is twice as big as 0.2
